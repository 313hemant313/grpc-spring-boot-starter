## Code style

We follow the [Google Java Style
Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html).

But we made some changes on this.

* Use INDENT_SIZE of 4
* Use TAB_SIZE of 4
* Use CONTINUATION_INDENT_SIZE of 4
 
Our build automatically will provide warnings for style issues.

and
[IntelliJ](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/yidongnan/73b641c6ea7abe8c6fdd/raw/5959a1af3157b91d92d19f6e485500112ae3f9ba/intellij-java-google-style.xml)
style configurations are commonly useful. For IntelliJ, copy the style to
`~/.IntelliJIdea***/config/codestyles/`, start IntelliJ, go to File > Settings > Code
Style, and set the Scheme to `GoogleStyle`.
