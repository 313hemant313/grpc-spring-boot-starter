# gRPC-Spring-Boot-Starter Documentation

gRPC-spring-boot-starter combines [google's open-source high performance RPC-framework](https://grpc.io) with
[spring boot's ease of setup](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
This project simplifies the gRPC-server/client setup to adding one dependency to your project and adding a single
annotation to your service class / client (stub) field.
The features of this library are meant to complement your experience with gRPC and still allow you to do any
customization you need for your project.
